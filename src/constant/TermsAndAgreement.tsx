It is important that you understand that smart contract protocols such as Krav simply comprise a set of autonomous blockchain-based smart contracts deployed on the relevant Blockchain Network, operated directly by users calling functions on it (which allows them to interact with other users in a multi-party peer-to-peer manner). There is no further control by or interaction with the original entity which had deployed the smart contract (i.e. the Company), which entity solely functions as a provider of technical tools for users, and is not offering any sort of securities product or regulated service nor does it hold any user assets on custody. Any rewards earned by user interactions arise solely out of their involvement in the protocol by taking on the risk of interacting with other users and the ecosystem.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6">Krav Trade Holdings Inc.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(the "</span><span class="c9">Company</span><span class="c6">", "</span><span class="c9">we</span><span class="c6">", "</span><span class="c9">our</span><span class="c6">" or "</span><span class="c9">us</span><span class="c6">") is making the App available to you.
